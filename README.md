# Robot_Rampage
A FPS arena with lots of robots

This is a FPS based of the tutorial in "Unity Games by Tutorials" with alterations


## Version 1.1

1. Tightened player movement and removed slow decel

2. Added several sound effects and mixed the sound using Sound manager
  a. Added female player hurt sound effect
  b. Added item pickup sound effect
  c. Sounds were mixed so the effect of hitting a robot is obvious to the player
  d. Robots tried to take revenge on player upon death by blaring their death sound effect, this was remixed to not deafen 
     the player
  
3. Adjust world physics so player can no longer permanently mount dead robots

4. Missles no longer launch player into the Unity multiverse

5. Adjusted player damage values to make the game faster paced
 a. Wave spawn timer was also lowered
 
6. Small optimizations for item cleanup

7. Fixed robot aim to more regularly hit their target

8. Added an additional teleporter to the arena

9.  The player can no longer ride missiles, it's cool in fortnite but not here
